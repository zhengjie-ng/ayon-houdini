## Invalid VDB output

All primitives of the output geometry must be VDBs, no other primitive
types are allowed. That means that regardless of the amount of VDBs in the
geometry it will have an equal amount of VDBs, points, primitives and
vertices since each VDB primitive is one point, one vertex and one VDB.

This validation only checks the geometry on the first frame of the export
frame range.
